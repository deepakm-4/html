    Drug addiction is a serious and growing problem that affects <mark>millions of people worldwide</mark>.
     It is a condition where individuals become dependent on substances such as  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocaine"><b>Cocaine</b></a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_(drug)" > <b> Marijuana(Cannabis)</b></a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methamphetamine" > <b> Methanpetamine </b> </a> or 
     other illegal drugs. Over time, the body and mind develop a tolerance, leading the person to use larger amounts to achieve the same effect. This dependency can severely
     impact a person’s physical and mental health, relationships, and overall quality of life.
    <br>
    The causes of drug addiction vary, but often include genetic factors, environmental influences, and emotional or <i> <u> <strong> psychological issues </strong> </u>. 
        Peer pressure, stress, and trauma  </i>can also contribute to the initiation of drug use. Once a person becomes addicted, it becomes increasingly difficult to break 
        free, as drugs alter the brain’s chemistry, making it hard to feel pleasure without them.
    <br>
         In conclusion, drug addiction is a complex and destructive issue, but with proper support and treatment, individuals can overcome it and rebuild their lives.<hr> </p>
